How to return an item:

All purchases made on the Campusden.com website can be returned or exchanged within 90 days of receipt of order. All returns must be in like-new condition and will require a Return Merchandise Authorization number (RMA#).

Customers are responsible for shipping items back to Campus Den, except in the case of: Damaged/Defective items, Wrong item was sent, Flawed items. For any return reason marked "Qualifies for free return service" Campus Den will email a printable UPS return label to the customer (You can expect to receive a shipping label by email within 5-7 business days from the time we receive your RMA request).

Please note: If you placed your order on our old site (order number lower than 63507) we have to put the RMA in for you. If this is the case, please use our contact form to let us know the details of your return. You can also call us at 855-564-9911 during regular business hours.
